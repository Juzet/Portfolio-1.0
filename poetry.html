			When I was younger I used to get mad when I didn't get my way, I was a pacifist and didn't want to hurt anyone I found a way to get rid of my anger and it was writing poetry. Since then I have written tons of poetry, some about my personal life and some about different things I see and hear walking around, wether it be negative or positve.
