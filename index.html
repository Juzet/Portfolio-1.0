	<h1> About Me</h1>
	<p>
		Hi, my name is Juzet Arana and I was born on June 19th, 1999 in Pasadena CA to Francis and JJ Arana. I am currently a 15 year old sophomore attending Pasadena High School. I have a lot of siblings but only three of them are my blood, Ah'Shirae Arana who is currently 18 years old and a Freshman attending UC Riverside, Jurii Arana who is 17 years old and a Senior attending Pasadena High School, and Ahmoray Arana who is 13 years old attending Marshall Fundamental Secondary High School. I plan to major in law when I go to college and I want to minor in business.
